# **Testing EDGES Reservation Software**

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on the **manual testing** of the EDGES Reservation Software. The aim is to evaluate the system's reliability, efficiency, and functionality to ensure it meets user requirements. The testing is based on **C Unit testing frameworks** and follows a systematic approach to verify and validate the behavior of the software modules.

## **Description**  
The EDGES Reservation Software is designed to facilitate a seamless reservation experience for its users. The project involves:  
- Writing and executing **manual test cases** to validate core functionalities.  
- Verifying edge cases and scenarios to ensure robust performance.  
- Analyzing results and generating detailed reports to document issues and recommendations.  

Graphs and visual data from the testing process are provided in the [Test Completion Report](https://github.com/Esraa-alii/Testing-EDGES-Reservation-software/blob/main/Testing%20Reports/Test%20Completion%20Report.pdf).
